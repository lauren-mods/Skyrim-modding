## What I did was:

### Identify references

I went into each BYOH house and manually identified the references. Then I made a note of these here. Then I closed the Creation Kit without saving any changes because I undoubtedly accidentally moved other objects.

### Editing 'Enable Parent'

Then I used 'Edit>Find Text' to look up each reference. I had to double click each object to edit. The field I edited was 'Enable Parent' Each edit I made I saved the file so I could use the * to see if I had accidentally made changes. I used View>Markers to toggle markers which obstructed objects.

### Checking

I tested the mod and found a hidden cabbage!

### Editing the hidden cabbage

I searched for wall basket 1 again and manually fixed the cabbage because there was no point in writing down the ref due to its hidden location.
